# Infant-growth-analysis
Statistical analysis of Infant growth metrics (weight, length, and head circumference) by gender using Python. Includes t-tests, bootstrapping, effect sizes, and visual insights.
This project explores growth differences between male and female babies using a dataset provided as part of an assessment question.

We analyze three key growth indicators of 256 infants (119 male infant and 137 female infants) at one month of age:
- Weight of babies
- Length of babies
- Head circumference of babies

## **Objectives**
This analysis aims to explore growth differences between male and female infant at one month. Specifically:
- Which gender tends to be longer.
- Whether boys generally weigh more than girls.
- If head circumferences are typically larger in male babies.
- If the relationship between length and weight differs by gender.
- Which gender shows more variation in measurements like length, weight, and head circumference.

### **Dataset**

The dataset was provided as part of a statistics assessment and contains measurements of length, weight, and head circumference for 256 one-month-old infants

Note: The data file is included in this repo as babies.xlsx

#### **Tools & Libraries**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Kaggle
- DataCamp
